# few-shot-learning
This project implements a few-shot learning model to classify images using limited training samples per class. It leverages metric-based approaches like Prototypical Networks to enable fast generalization on unseen classes with minimal labeled data. Ideal for tasks where collecting large datasets is impractical.
